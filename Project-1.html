          <p class="p1">Just as its name is expressed, monospaced fonts, are fonts in which all characters have the same amount of horizontal space-a feature different from most of the fonts we commonly see, which have variant breadths between letters and are classified as proportional fonts. Monospaced fonts thrived in the twenty century, a period that typewriter was wildly used in offices and homes, and computers were still as large as a room and weighed more than a sedan car. The kind of fonts was designed for utilitarian and sturdy rather than for advertising or decoration. Monospaced fonts were used on typewriters at first because the equal breadth feature allowed typewriters carriage to move the paper the same distance each time when a typist pressed a key, which makes the writing process smoothly.</p>
