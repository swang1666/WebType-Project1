        <h2 class="animated-title">The Development of Monospaced Font</h2>
        <p class="p1">Just as its name is expressed, monospaced fonts, are fonts in which all characters have the same amount of horizontal space-a feature different from most of the fonts we commonly see, which have variant breadths between letters and are classified as proportional fonts. Monospaced fonts thrived in the twenty century, a period that typewriter was wildly used in offices and homes, and computers were still as large as a room and weighed more than a sedan car. The kind of fonts was designed for utilitarian and sturdy rather than for advertising or decoration. Monospaced fonts were used on typewriters at first because the equal breadth feature allowed typewriters carriage to move the paper the same distance each time when a typist pressed a key, which makes the writing process smoothly.</p>

       <p class="p2">The earliest monospaced font I can find is called Courier. It was released in the year 1956 designed by Howard "Bud" Kettler for IBM's typewriters. By the 1960s, a few years after Courier published, the font became so popular that you could find it almost every where-from screenplays to formal documents. By the 1960s, a few years after Courier published, the font became so popular that you could find it almost every where-from screenplays to formal documents.In the next three decades, monospaced fonts became a trend. The monospaced fonts could easily migrate to phototypesetting technology in the 1970s and in the 1980s, they were widely used in computer gaming, especially Courier-it was one of the handfuls of fonts available on personal computers.
 </p><p class="p2">Nowadays, monospaced fonts are commonly seen in computer programming. The font family again benefits from its same-breadth feature, thriving in the coding area, just as it was popular on typewriters.</p>

     <p class="p3">Monospaces fonts take more places than proportional fonts which means there are more spaces between each character. Programming, in contrast with traditional typography, focuses more on individual characters rather than words or sentences. With the wide space between each letter, programmers can recognize bugs easier than locating a specific letter in text with normal typefaces. Moreover, monospaced fonts generally differentiate better between similar characters, such as 0oO, and give more space to important syntactical characters, which make code looks clean. However, the feature also can be a weakness of the typefaces either. Monospaced typefaces are not good typefaces for body text. Compared to proportional fonts, monospaced fonts are harder to read because of the larger, even spaces between letters. And because they take up more horizontal space, youâ€™ll always get fewer words per page with a monospaced font.</p>

          As monospaced fonts develop, the family comes in many flavors: the retro, typewriter-like style, the hard-edged, contemporary style, and styles that cannot be simply classified. FF Trixie font is the most famous retro typewriter-style font. It was designed in 1991. The font is very easy to be recognized with its dependent flaws: the height and baseline of the typeface are variant and the edges of the letters are rough, ragged, and smudged with ink. The font was designed for a large scale to displace all the flaws clearly. The letter X in this font was used on the poster of the X file.

Hard-edged, industrial-strength typefaces are mainly used in coding which is identified by their names, such as Adaptive Code, Fira Code, and  Monospace 821 BT.

Pitch is a monospaced font inspired by typewriter typefaces but discards the flaws imitating printed texts. The typeface keeps the elegant feeling of the monospaced font in a different way- it is designed in a linear fashion, with angled brackets, and ball terminal.</p>
